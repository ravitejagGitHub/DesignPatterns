## Design Patterns

Design patterns are reusable solutions to commonly occurring problems in software design

Design patterns can be categorized in multiple ways, but the most popular one is the following:

1) Creational design patterns
2) Structural design patterns
3) Behavioral design patterns


# Creational Design Patterns
These patterns deal with object creation mechanisms which optimize object creation compared to a basic approach. 

Creational design patterns solve this problem by somehow controlling object creation. Some of the popular design patterns in this category are:

•	Prototype
•	Factory method
•	Singleton
•	Abstract Factory
•	Builder 


# Structural Design Patterns
These patterns deal with object relationships. They ensure that if one part of a system changes, the entire system doesn’t need to change along with it. The most popular patterns in this category are:

•	Proxy
•	Decorator
•	Bridge
•	Composite
•	Flyweight
•	Adapter
•	Facade


# Behavioral Design Patterns
These types of patterns recognize, implement, and improve communication between disparate objects in a system.

Popular examples of these patterns are:

•	Strategy
•	State
•	Template method
•	Chain of responsibility
•	Iterator
•	Command
•	Mediator
•	Observer
•	Visitor
•	Interpreteur
•	Memento
